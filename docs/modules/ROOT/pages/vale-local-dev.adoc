= Vale local development guide
:page-tags: diataxis:reference, domain:platform, audience:contrib, stability:beta
:reviewed: 2025-11-19

This repository uses Vale for documentation linting. CI runs the Google and Microsoft styles; the `n00` local style keeps day-to-day checks focused and fast.

== Quick commands

* `vale sync`: Refresh installed style packs and ensure the local vocabulary is loaded.
* `VALE_LOCAL=1 make validate-docs`: Run the lightweight `n00` checks (recommended while authoring).
* `vale --output=JSON --ignore-syntax docs > artifacts/vale-full.json`: Run a full CI-style check and write JSON to `artifacts/vale-full.json`.

== Developer helpers

* `pnpm -s docs:vale-triage`: Parse the full run JSON and create a triage report grouped by file and check. The triage report is written to `artifacts/vale-triage.json`.
* `pnpm -s docs:fix-style`: Apply a small set of safe editorial normalizations to `.adoc` files (commas, spacing, ellipses, and other low-risk normalizations).
* `pnpm -s docs:generate-spelling-counts`: Produce a JSON with `Vale.Spelling` token counts to guide whitelist decisions.
* `pnpm -s docs:vale-whitelist-candidates`: Produce a shortlist of high-frequency tokens for review (candidates for whitelisting).
* `pnpm -s docs:vale-terms-candidates`: Produce a shortlist of frequent `Vale.Terms` tokens and proposed edits or whitelist candidates. Flags: `--threshold <n>`, `--dry-run`, `--output <file>`, `--json <path>`.

Additional flags include `--whitelist [vocab|terms]` (append tokens to `styles/n00/vocab.txt` by default), `--apply-edits` (apply Vale-suggested editorial replacements conservatively), `--interactive` (prompt for confirmation), and `--yes` (skip confirmation prompts).

[TIP]
====
`vale-whitelist-candidates.mjs` accepts `--threshold <n>` to lower the frequency threshold for candidates; the default is 3. For example:

[source,shell]
----
node scripts/vale-whitelist-candidates.mjs --threshold 2
----
====

== Notes

* Add project acronyms and tooling names into `styles/config/vocabularies/n00/accept.txt` and run `vale sync`.
* Use the triage report to prioritise fixes and to identify tokens worth whitelisting.

== Notes about edits and backups

* `--apply-edits` creates a backup of any edited file at `+{path}.bak+` before writing changes.
* Prefer running `--apply-edits --dry-run` to preview edits. Then run `--apply-edits --yes` to apply.
* `--whitelist` appends tokens to `styles/n00/vocab.txt` by default. Use `--whitelist terms` to append to `styles/n00/Terms.yml` instead.

== Markdown / AsciiDoc linting

* The repository contains a `config.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` file tuned for AsciiDoc. It relaxes rules for long table lines, inline HTML, bare URLs, and other AsciiDoc-specific cases.
* To lint AsciiDoc files with the repository config, run:

[source,shell]
----
pnpm -s exec markdownlint-cli2 --config.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc "docs/**/*.adoc"
----

== Best practices

* Prefer using the `n00` local run while writing. Run the full CI-style Vale check (Google/Microsoft styles) to confirm final issues before a PR.
* Curate whitelists intentionally. Prefer whitelisting true project names or acronyms (for example, `ERPNext`, `Algolia`, `pnpm`) rather than typos.
* To preview the editorial patches applied by `docs:fix-style`, run:

[source,shell]
----
node scripts/fix-docs-style.mjs --pattern "docs/**/*.adoc" --dry-run
----

If you'd like help, prepare a short PR that (1) curates a whitelist, (2) applies small editorial fixes across a subset of pages, and (3) re-runs the full Vale check to show the impact.

== CI and validation hooks

* The repository includes a workspace-level health check that runs Python formatting and linting across the workspace. You can run it locally by invoking the pnpm script:

[source,shell]
----
pnpm run lint:python
----

The workspace CI runs this script automatically as part of the `workspace-health` workflow.
